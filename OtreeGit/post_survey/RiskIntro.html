Next, you will be making 5 choices between a lottery and a sure payment<br>
<br>

<p>
    On the next pages you can <b>choose between a sure payment and a lottery</b>.
The lottery gives you a 50 percent chance of receiving 30 Money Units. With an equally high chance you receive nothing.
You have to choose between the lottery and a sure payment. We will present to you <b>five different situations</b>.
The <b>lottery is the same </b>in all situations. The <b>sure payment is different </b>in every situation.
</p>
<p>
    Dependent on your last choice, you will receive a bonus payment that is <b> either the sure payment </b>or a<b>
    randomly drawn outcome from the lottery</b> (30 Money Units or nothing).

The lottery choice task will begin on the next page.
