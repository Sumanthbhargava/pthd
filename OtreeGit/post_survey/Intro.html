<p>
    First you will be asked to do a distribution task. In this task you have been randomly paired with another person from you group, whom we will refer to as the other.
    You will be making a number of decisions about distributing resources between you and this other person.
    For each of the following questions, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by marking the respective
    position along the slider. You can only make one mark for each question.
</p>
<p>
    Your decisions will yield money for both yourself and the other person.
    One of your decisions will be chosen at random and paid out to you and the other participant.
    Additionally, you will receive the Money Units from a decision made by a third participant,
    who is independent of your decisions in this task.
</p>

<br>
The distribution task will begin on the next page.
