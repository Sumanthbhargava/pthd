<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    In this task, you have been randomly paired with another person from your group,
    whom we will refer to as the other person. You are going to make a series of decisions about
    the distribution of resources between you and this other person. For each of the following questions,
    please indicate your preferred allocation by marking the appropriate position on the slider.
    You can only make one mark for each question.
</p>
<p>
    Your decisions will earn money for both you and the other person.
    One of your decisions will be chosen at random and paid out to you and the other participant.
    In addition, you will receive the Money Units from a decision made by a third player who is
    independent of your decisions in this task.
