    You have now solved the comprehension check and <strong>completed the tutorial</strong>.

<p>
    On the next page you will be assigned to a <strong>group of 5 with 4 other Prolific participants</strong>.
    <!--    TODO: Flexible number?-->
    You may need to wait for other participants to join.
    Please be patient until a group of participants can be formed.

    <p>
        If you are successfully <strong>assigned to a group</strong>
<!--        with other Prolific participants,-->
        <strong>you will immediately start</strong> with the first stage of the first round of the task.
        <!--        first see a <strong>short summary of the instructions</strong>,-->
        <!--        including <strong>information about your sharing cost</strong>-->

        In the unlikely case that <strong>nobody else shows up within {{ wait_time_minutes }}&nbsp;minutes,
        you can claim a completion code</strong>, can complete the study and will receive the flat fee of
        {{ participation_fee }} and a bonus for waiting.
